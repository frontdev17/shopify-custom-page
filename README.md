## Shopify Custom Page - College Essentials Store

This project is a college-themed eCommerce storefront that integrates with Shopify's Storefront API and the Shopify Buy SDK to dynamically display and manage products. It simulates an online store for college students, featuring essential items like backpacks, study lamps, and accessories.

This project was built as part of a front-end development portfolio to demonstrate API integration, responsive UI design, and interactive shopping features.

## Features

- College-themed store layout with a modern, clean design  
- Live Shopify product listings fetched via Shopify Storefront API  
- Product variant selection (sizes, colors, etc.)  
- Dynamic shopping cart with real-time price updates  
- Payment method icons for a professional checkout appearance  
- Secure checkout button (disabled for demo purposes)  
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly  

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Shopify Storefront API and Shopify Buy SDK  
- GitHub Pages for deployment  
- Google Fonts and UI animations  

## How It Works

1. Users browse college-essential products fetched from Shopify.  
2. They can select product variants, such as different sizes or colors.  
3. Adding items to the cart updates the total price dynamically.  
4. Checkout functionality is disabled since this is a demo.
